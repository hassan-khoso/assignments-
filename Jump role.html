    </h1> 
        <p> jump rope (American English) is a tool used in the sport of skipping/jump rope where one or more
            participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are
            multiple subsets of skipping/jump rope, including single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three-person speed
            (Double Dutch), and three-person freestyle (Double Dutch freestyle).
        </p>
        <P> There are a few major organizations that support jump rope as a sport. Often separated by sex and age,
            events include hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. In the US, schools rarely have jump rope
            teams, and states do have sanction official events for elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers use a
            variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge,
            content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going
            around the jumper every time one of their feet hits the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes.
            The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.
        </P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Each time the rope twirls, another person joins in the jumping.</li>
            <li>So you start with one jumper, then two, and so on, until the chain is broken and there's a missed jump.
                (Some skilled twirling will help prolong the game by making it easier for new players to join in.)</li>
            <li>Combined Alternate Step and Jogging.</li>
