        <p>A three-legged race is a running event involving pairs of participants running with the left leg of one
            runner strapped to the right leg of another runner.The objective is for the partners to beat the other
            contestant pairs to the finish line.
        </p>
        <P>Use two ropes to mark a starting line and a finish line.
            Have the players line up at the starting line. At your signal, have players walk or run as fast as they can to the finish line.
            It sounds easy, but it takes practice to make two legs work as one! The winners are the pair of children who cross the finish line first.
        </P>

            <li>The partners' inside legs (the right leg of the partner on the left and the left leg of the partner on
                the right) should be touching. Tie the partners' inside legs together so each pair of children has three
                legs rather than four.</li>
