        <p>Passing The Hula Hoop  First, divide your players into teams of 8 to 15 (ish) players. Have your teams stand in a long line holding hands. Each line of players should be parallel to the others.This hula hoop game is great for picnics, recess, or birthday parties where you have a whole group of attendees. Have everyone hold hands and stand in a line or circle. To start the game, loop the hoop over a player's arm. From there, the rest of the group must pass the hoop down the line or around the circle without letting go of each other's hands.This hula hoop game is great for picnics, recess, or birthday parties where you have a whole group of attendees.

        <P>Give each team a hula hoop. Start the hula hoop at one end of the line, handing it to the player on the end. At “go,” the players must pass the hula hoop all the way down the line of players. The trick is, since they’re holding hands, they’ve got to do it by shimmying and wiggling their bodies through the hula hoop–no grabbing of the hula hoop allowed.
