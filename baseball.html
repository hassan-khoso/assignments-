            </h1>
            <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and
                fielding. The game is in play when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that
                a
                player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team)
                is to
                hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the
                bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The
                objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming
                runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally
                advances
                around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
            </p>
            <P>The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally
                occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball
                and
                touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. Players
                on
                the batting team who reach first base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent
                bases
                as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent
                runs
                by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the
                batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by
                catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the
                ball
                while the runner is not touching a base.
            </P>
