                Ring toss is a game where rings are tossed around a peg.It is common at amusement parks.A variant,
                sometimes
                referred to as "ring-a-bottle", replaces pegs with bottles, where the thrower may keep the bottle (and
                its
                contents) if successful.Ring toss is also a game for toddlers and children that can assist in the
                development of motor skills and
                hand-eye coordination development.

                The game of ring toss probably developed from the British game of quoits. Quoits are light metal rings
                about
                six inches across. Players toss the quoits at iron "hobs" placed 18 yards apart. There are records of
                quoits
                being played as early as the 14th century, and the game may have developed from the Greek sport of
                discus
                throwing. The British and other Europeans spread the game of quoits as they explored and colonized.
                There is
                a Peruvian legend about an Incan king who was murdered while playing quoits with the Spanish
                conquistadores
