        <p>
            Horseshoes is a lawn game played between two people (or two teams of two people) using four horseshoes and
            two throwing targets (stakes) set in a lawn or sandbox area. The game is played by the players alternating
            turns tossing horseshoes at stakes in the ground, which are traditionally placed 40 feet (12 m) apart.
            Modern games use a more stylized U-shaped bar, about twice the size of an actual horseshoe.
        </p>
        <P>Single points in amateur games must measure 6 inches or less from any part of the shoe to the nearest part of
            the stake. Also, a game cannot be won when an opposing player, tossing a shoe, bumps an opponent's shoe to
            cause the opponent to reach the winning score be it 11 or 21. The game-winning point must be attained by the
            person tossing the horseshoe pertaining to his own score. Examples: If a player has 10 points and an
            opponent has 8 points, and the player with 10 points tosses a horseshoe and bumps his opponent's horseshoe
            for a ringer, the opponent scores 3 points for a total of 11 points, but does not win the game because of
            the two-point rule. If a player has 9 points and an opponent 8 points and the player with 9 points tosses a
            horseshoe and bumps his opponent's horseshoe for a ringer, the opponent cannot score 3 points, because the
            winning point must be attained by his own toss. However, the opponent can take two points, bringing his
            total point score to 10.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You must pitch both shoes from the same side in each inning, but you can pitch from different sides throughout the match.</li>
            <li>Pitch both shoes within 30 seconds of stepping into a pitching area. </li>
            <li>Aim for the stake at the opposite end of the pitch. Players typically pitch the shoes underhanded.
            </li>
