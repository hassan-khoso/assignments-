            </h1>
            <p>Jenga is a game of physical skill Players take turns removing one block at a time from a tower
                constructed of
                54 blocks. Each block removed is then placed on top of the tower, creating a progressively more unstable
                structure.
            </p>
            <P> Starting with the one who built the tower, players take turns removing one block from any level below
                the
                highest completed one and placing it horizontally atop the tower, perpendicular to any blocks on which
                it is
                to rest. Each player may use only one hand to touch the tower or move a block at any given time, but may
                switch hands whenever desired. Once a level contains three blocks, it is complete and may not have any
                more
                blocks added to it. A block may be touched or nudged to determine whether it is loose enough to remove
                without disturbing the rest of the tower, but it must be returned to its original position if the player
                decides to move a different one. A turn ends when the next player in sequence touches the tower or when
                10
                seconds have elapsed since the placement of a block, whichever occurs first.
            </P>
