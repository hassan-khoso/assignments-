    </h1> 
        <p>he sack race or potato sack race is a competitive game in which participants place both of their legs inside
            a sack or pillow case that reaches their waist or neck and hop forward from a starting point toward a finish
            line. The first person to cross the finish line is the winner of the race.

            Possible rule changes that people make to the traditional game include using extra large sacks and running
            inside the bag; however, in some cases such activity may be viewed as cheating.
        </p>
        <P>Sack racing is traditionally seen as an activity for children, but people of any age can compete. In schools,
            the sack race often takes place on a Sports Day, along with numerous other events such as the egg and spoon
            race. It is also a frequent pastime at fairs, birthday parties, and picnics.
        </P>
