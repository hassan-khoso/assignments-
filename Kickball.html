        <p>Kickball (also known as soccer baseball in most of Canada and football rounders in the United Kingdom) is a
            sport and league game, similar to baseball. As in baseball, one team tries to score by having its players
            return a ball from home base to the field and then circle the bases, while the other team tries to stop them
            by tagging them "out" with the ball before they can return to the home base. Instead of hitting a small,
            hard ball with a bat, players kick an inflated rubber ball; this makes it more accessible to young children.
            As in baseball, teams alternate half-innings. The team with the most runs after a predefined number of
            innings wins.
        </p>
        <P>Kickball is a popular playground game and is typically played among young, school-age children.[citation
            needed] The lack of both specialized equipment and highly skill-based positions (like pitcher) makes the
            game an accessible introduction to other sports such as baseball and softball.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Kickball can be played on any type of pitch or surface but it is most usually played on a softball
                diamond.</li>
            <li>Games often consist of 6 innings, but this can be flexible when not playing under WAKA rules as long as
                both teams agree.
            </li>
            <li>Because Kickball is usually played in school sports sessions, then team sizes can vary, although WAKA
                recommends teams should be between 8 and 11.</li>
