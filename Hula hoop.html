        <p>A hula hoop is a toy hoop that is twirled around the waist, limbs or neck. They have been used by children
            and adults since at least 500 BC. The modern hula hoop was inspired by Australian bamboo hoops. The new
            plastic version was popularized in 1958 by the Wham-O toy company and became a fad.
        </p>
        <P> Hula hoops for children generally measure approximately 70 centimetres (28 in) in diameter, while those for
            adults measure around 100 centimetres (39 in). Traditional materials for hoops include willow, rattan (a
            flexible and strong vine), grapevines and stiff grasses. Commercial hoops are usually made of plastic
            tubing.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> The record is for continuous revolution of a hula hoop.</li>
            <li>A standard size and weight hula hoop must be used.</li>
            <li>If the hoop passes below the hips the competitor has 30 seconds in which to try to recover it without
                using his/her hands or arms. If the hoop is not revolving above the hips within 30 seconds the attempt
                is ended.
