        <p>Miniature golf, also known as minigolf, mini-putt, goofy golf, crazy golf, or putt-putt, is an offshoot of
            the sport of golf focusing solely on the putting aspect of its parent game. The aim of the game is to score
            the lowest number of points. It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of
            9) similar to its parent, but characterized by their short length (usually within 10 yards from tee to cup).


        </p>
        <P>The game uses artificial putting surfaces (such as carpet, artificial turf, or concrete), a geometric layout
            often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels,
            tubes, ramps, moving obstacles such as windmills, and walls of concrete, metal, or fiberglass. When
            miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is
            purely a mini version of its parent game.
        </P>
