            Pick-up sticks, pick-a-stick, jackstraws, jack straws, spillikins, or spellicans is a game of physical and
            mental skill in which a bundle of sticks, between 8 and 20 centimeters long, is dropped as a loose bunch
            onto a table top into a random pile. Each player, in turn, tries to remove a stick from the pile without
            disturbing any of the others. The object of the game is to pick up the most sticks or to score the most
            points based on the color of the sticks.
        </P>

            The game is believed to have developed from the yarrow stalks used for divination with the Chinese I Ching.
            It was first published in Germany about 1850. The sticks may be made of almost any material, such as ivory,
            bone, wood, bamboo, straw, reed, rush, yarrow, or plastics. Some Haida First Nation pick-up sticks are plain
            maple wood decorated with abalone shell and copper.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Player one begins the game by holding all of the sticks in their hand and then dropping them to the ground, scattering them across the floor.
            </li>
            <li>The player then proceeds to pick up the sticks, one by one, without moving any sticks other than the stick they are attempting to pick up.
            </li>
            <li> If any of the other sticks are moved, the players turn ends, and play continues to the left.
            </li>
        </ul>
