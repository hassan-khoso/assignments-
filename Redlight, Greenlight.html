    </h1>
    <p>There are different levels of stringency in regard to how much movement the Caller may observe to send a player
        back to the start. Some allow general movement as long as the players are not moving their feet from the ground,
        while others restrict any large bodily movements, such as swaying of the arms or even smiling. Blinking and
        breathing are generally permitted.
    </p>
    <P>he Flemish version of the game is called "1, 2, 3 Piano", in which the Caller shouts "één, twee, drie, piano!"
        (translating to one, two, three, piano in English) before turning around to the other players. Only during the
        time this sentence is being shouted, the participants are allowed to move
    </P>
    <P>In the Dutch version,[citation needed] instead of "green light!" the Caller sings in a slow voice "Annemaria",
        followed by a quick and loud "Koekoek!" ("Cuckoo!") when they turn around (like "red light!"). "Koekoek!" is
        also the Dutch equivalent of a Peekaboo game played with babies, where the parents hide their face with their
        hands, then reveal themselves whilst saying "Peek-a-boo!" (also known in Dutch as "Kiekeboe!")

    <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A person starts out as the "curator" (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone
            else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is
            for a "statue" to tag the curator, thereby becoming the curator and resetting the game.</li>
        <li>The curator turns their back to the field, and the "statues" attempt to race across and tag the curator.
        </li>
        <li>Whenever the curator turns around, the statues must freeze in position and hold that for as long as the
            curator looks at them. The curator may even be allowed to walk around the statues, examining them. However,
            the curator needs to be careful – whenever the curator's back is turned, statues are allowed to move.</li>
        <li>If a statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line to begin again or eliminated</li>
