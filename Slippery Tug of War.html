    </h1>  
        <p>The game has to be played on a flat grassy patch of land. A line referred to as a center line is
            marked on the playing zone and the rope is placed in a manner that its center mark should align
            the center marked on the ground. On either sides of the rope at the distance of 4 m from the
            center line, 2 more marks need to be made. This is the point where in the first member of each
            team will stand.
        </p>
        <P>The tug of war competition requires a judge. There are 3 different commands that the judge
            gives to the players. The judge first announces “Pick up the rope”, he then says “Take the
            string”, and finally he tells the players to “Pull”. Once the pull command is said out the teams
            start pulling the rope. If a member of the team falls down that member is given a caution. Each
            team is allowed two cautions before getting disqualified.
        </P>
