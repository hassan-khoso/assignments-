        <p>
            Concentration (card game) are games that require players to match similar elements. Participants need to find a match
            for a word, picture, or card. For example, students place 30 word cards; composed of 15 pairs, face down in
            random order. Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by
            using their memory.
        </p>
        <P>Concentration can be played with any number of players or as a solitaire or patience game. It is a
            particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.
            The scheme is often used in quiz shows (in fact, several game shows have used its name in their titles) and
            can be employed as an educational game.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
