        <p>
            Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle disputes between two people. Thought to be a game of chance
            that depends on random luck similar to flipping coins or drawing straws, the game is often taught to
            children to help them settle arguments between themselves on their own without adult intervention. However,
            the game actually can be a game that has an element of skill that requires quick thinking and perceptive
            reasoning.
        </p>
        <P> In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock (made by making
            a fist), paper (made by laying your hand flat), or scissors (made by holding out two fingers to look like
            scissors). Both players show their signs at the same time to see who will win.</P>
