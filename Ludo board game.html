        <p>
            Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from
            start to finish according to the rolls of a single die
        </p>
        <P>Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is
            assigned a colour and has four tokens[c] in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped
            playspace, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle
            columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's home column. A sixth coloured square
            not on the home column is a player's starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing
            square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting "arrows"
            pointing to the finish).</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Two, three, or four can play, without partnerships. At the beginning of the game, each player's four
                tokens are out of play and staged in the player's yard (one of the large corner areas of the board in
                the player's colour).</li>
            <li>When able to, the players enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting squares and
                proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of
                any player's home column).</li>
            <li>When reaching the square below their home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to
                the finishing square. The rolls of a single die.</li>
        </ul>
