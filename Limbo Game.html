    </h1> 
        <p>
            Limbo is a popular game, based on traditions that originated on the island of Trinidad. The aim is to pass
            forwards under a low bar without falling or dislodging the bar.
        </p>
        <P> A horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is supported by two vertical bars. All contestants must attempt to
            go under the bar with their backs facing toward the floor. When passing under the bar, players must bend
            backwards. No part of their body is allowed to touch the bar, and no part other than their feet may touch
            the ground. They must not turn their head or neck to the side. Whoever knocks the bar off or falls is
            eliminated. After everyone has passed under the bar in this manner, the bar is lowered slightly and the
            contest continues. The contest ends when only one person can pass under the bar.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The rules of limbo are deceptively simple, yet it takes an individual with remarkable flexibility to
                perform well..</li>
            <li> A pole is held parallel to the ground by two people (or propped up on a stand). </li>
            <li>The contestants form a line and, in turn, they attempt to pass under the bar. After everyone in the line
                has made an attempt, the bar is lowered an inch or two and the process repeats.</li>
