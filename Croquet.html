        <p>
            Croquet is a sport that involves hitting wooden or plastic balls with a mallet through hoops embedded in a
            grass playing court. Its international governing body is the World Croquet Federation.
        </p>
        <P>There are several variations of croquet, but the main ones which have official internationally approved rules
            are Association Croquet and Golf Croquet. Both of these are played at the club and use exactly the same
            equipment (six cast iron hoops, one peg, four balls and mallets), and for both of which we provide free and
            expert coaching.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>There are four balls, blue, red, black and yellow, which must be played in that order (the colours are
                painted on the centre peg to act as a reminder).</li>
            <li>The hoops, peg, and other balls cannot be moved to facilitate play.</li>
            <li>The person whose turn it is to play is called the striker. A turn consists of just one strike. In
                Singles: one player uses the blue and black balls, the other red and yellow. In Doubles: each player
                strikes his own ball â€“ with blue partnering black and red partnering yellow.</li>
        </ul>
