        <p>
            Cornhole (also known regionally as bags, sack toss, or bean bag toss) is a lawn game popular in North
            America in which players or teams take turns throwing fabric bean bags at a raised, angled board with a hole
            in its far end. The goal of the game is to score points by either landing a bag on the board (one point) or
            putting a bag through the hole (three points).
        </p>
        <P>Although bags used to be filled with preserved corn kernels (hence "cornhole") or dried beans, bags are now
            usually filled with plastic resin or other materials that will maintain a consistent weight and shape over
            many throws without deforming. Bags are usually dual-sided, with each side of the bag being a different
            material that can affect grip and react faster or slower on the board's surface. Faster bags are often
            preferred in humid conditions when bags will not slide as readily. Additionally, professional players may
            opt for different materials depending on their personal throwing styles. Players with a lower, faster throw
            may use more rotation and prefer a slower bag material, whereas players with higher, slower throws may use
            less rotation and prefer a more reactive bag.</P>
