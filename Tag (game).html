    </h1>  
        <p>Tag (also called tig, it, tiggy, tips, tick, tip) is a playground game involving two or more players chasing
            other players in an attempt to "tag" and mark them out of play, usually by touching with a hand. There are
            many variations; most forms have no teams, scores, or equipment. Usually, when a person is tagged, the
            tagger says, "Tag, you're 'it'!" The last one tagged during tag is "it" for the next round. The game is
            known by other names in various parts of the world, including “running and catching” in India and “catch and
            cook” in the Middle East
        </p>
        <P>Players may be safe from being tagged under certain circumstances: if they are within a pre-determined area,
            off the ground, or when touching a particular structure. Traditional variants are Wood tag (see knock on
            wood), Iron tag, and Stone tag, when a player is safe when touching the named material.[3] This safe zone
            has been called a "gool", "ghoul", or "Dell",[4][5] probably a corruption of "goal".[6] The term "gool" was
            first recorded in print in Massachusetts in the 1870s, and is common in the northern states of the US.
            Variants include gould, goul, and ghoul, and alternatives include base and home.[7] In the United Kingdom,
            the base is frequently known as "den". In much of Canada and parts of the northern United States, the state
            or home base of being immune from tagging is known as "times" or "T", most likely as mutilation of "time
            out".

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Many variants modify the rules for team play or place restrictions on tagged players' behavior. A simple
                variation makes tag an elimination game, so that tagged drop out of play.</li>
            <li>Some variants have a rule preventing a player from tagging the person who has just tagged them (known as
                "no tag-backs", "no catch-backs", "no returns", "can't tag your master" or "can't get the butcher
                back").
            </li>
            <li>g makes the tagged player "it". In some variations, the previous "it" is no longer "it" and the game can
                continue indefinitely, while in others, both players remain "it" and the game ends when all players have
                become "it"</li>
        </ul>
