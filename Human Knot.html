        <p>
            A human knot is a common icebreaker game or team building activity for new people to learn to work together
            in physical proximity.

            The knot is a disentanglement puzzle in which a group of people in a circle each hold hands with two people
            who are not next to them, and the goal is to disentangle the limbs to get the group into a circle, without
            letting go of grasped hands. Instead, group members should step over or under arms to try to untangle the
            knot. Not all human knots are solvable (see unknotting problem) and can remain knots or may end up as two or
            more circles.
        </p>
        <P>An easy way to ensure that the game will end up with a single circle with no nodes is to start from a circle
            of people holding each other hand, looking all towards the center of the circle, and ask some of them to
            cross his/her arms and swap his left hand with his right hand grasping again the same neighbors. When the
            game is successfully completed a certain number of people will appear to be outside of the circle. This
            number equals the number of people having crossed arms. The challenge is to solve the game several times
            starting each time with an increasing number of crossed people. To increase the difficulty level, players
            can be blindfolded or required that the game be played silently (no talking).
