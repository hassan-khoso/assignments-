            Dominoes is a family of tile-based games played with gaming pieces, commonly known as dominoes. Each domino
            is a rectangular tile, usually with a line dividing its face into two square ends. Each end is marked with a
            number of spots (also called pips or dots) or is blank. The backs of the tiles in a set are
            indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The gaming pieces make up a domino set,
            sometimes called a deck or pack. The traditional European domino set consists of 28 tiles, also known as
            pieces, bones, rocks, stones, men, cards or just dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between
            zero and six. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to playing cards or dice, in that a variety
            of games can be played with a set. Another form of entertainment using domino pieces is the practice of
            domino toppling.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The first player lays a tile down facing upwards the next player can lay a tile so the adjoining tile
                value matches i.e. if you lay a tile with three and four pips or dots the next player can only lay a
                tile with either three or four pips or dots.
            </li>
            <li>Place the tiles on edge but do not allow your opponent to see the dominoes.
            </li>
            <li>You will eventually build a trail of tiles and you can always place a tile at either end of the trail
                so long as you have a matching tile of equal value.
            </li>
        </ul>
