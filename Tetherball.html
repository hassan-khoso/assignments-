    </h1> 
        <p>Tetherball is a game where two players use their hands to strike a volleyball which is suspended from a
            stationary metal pole by a rope or tether. The two players stand on opposite sides of the pole, and each
            tries to hit the ball one way; one clockwise, and one counterclockwise. The game ends when one player
            manages to wind the ball all the way around the pole so that it is stopped by the rope. It must not bounce.
        </p>
        <P>The game begins when one player enters the court and yells "Sides and ways" then serves the ball in the
            direction he or she chooses (provided that person yelled it first), usually by hitting it off the post, or
            after the opposing player serves it, he or she cannot touch it until the other player touches it. The
            opposing player then attempts to return the serve by hitting it in the opposite direction. The object is to
            hit the ball in such a way that one's opponent will be unable to alter the ball's direction. This gives the
            server an advantage since the server has more control over the ball from the beginning. It is generally
            acceptable to hit the ball with either the fist or the open hand or swing.
        </P>
