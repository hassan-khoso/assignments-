        <p>
            This is not the traditional Spin The Bottle game – it has a fun kitty twist. For this game, arrange some
            bottles of nail paint in a circle on your table, leaving enough space in the middle to spin a bottle. Form a
            circle around the table. One by one, each member of the kitty has to spin the bottle. When the bottle stops
            spinning, the lady toward whom the bottle is pointing has to paint her nails with the nail paint in front of
            her within a minute.
        </p>
        <P> Try to paint as many nails as possible in a minute. Spin the bottle until all the ladies get a chance. When
            all the ladies get their turns, the lady with most nails painted wins. Also, make sure to look for the lady
            who has painted her nails neatly if there’s a tie</P>
