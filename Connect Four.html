            Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row,
            Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players
            choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended
            grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective
            of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
            Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
        </p>
        <P>A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow
            discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of
            their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal
            four in a row, and wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then
            the game is a draw.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Several versions of Hasbro's Connect Four physical gameboard make it easy to remove game pieces from the
                bottom one at a time. Along with traditional gameplay, this feature allows for variations of the game.
            </li>
            <li>Some earlier game versions also included specially-marked discs, and cardboard column extenders, for additional variations to the game.</li>
            <li>The most commonly-used Connect Four board size is 7 columns × 6 rows. Size variations include 5×4, 6×5, 8×7, 9×7, 10×7, 8×8, Infinite Connect-Four,and Cylinder-Infinite Connect-Four.</li>
