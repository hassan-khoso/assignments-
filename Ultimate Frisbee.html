    </h1> 
        <p>Ultimate, originally known as ultimate Frisbee, is a non-contact team activity played by players with a
            frisbee, flung by hand. Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in
            Maplewood, New Jersey. Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it
            is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition
        </p>
        <P> The term Frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the
            Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called "ultimate Frisbee", though this name is still
            in common casual use. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other
            basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete
            passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a
            testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.
        </P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line.</li>
            <li>Standing beyond the end zone line before the disc is thrown by the defense (a "pull") to the offense is
                known as an "offsides" violation.</li>
            <li>A regulation grass outdoor game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play
                with a "4-3" ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 men will be playing. The offensive
                end zone dictates whether there are more men or women.</li>
