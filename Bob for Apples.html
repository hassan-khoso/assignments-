        <p>Apple bobbing, also known as bobbing for apples, is a game often played on Halloween. The game is played by
            filling a tub or a large basin with water and putting apples in the water. Because apples are less dense
            than water, they will float at the surface. Players (usually children) then try to catch one with their
            teeth. Use of arms is not allowed, and the hands are often tied behind the back to prevent cheating.
        </p>
        <P> common variant of bobbing of apples is the game snap apple or apple on a string, in which apples are hung
            from the ceiling and contestants jump to take bites - the winner is the contestant that manages to eat their
            entire apple first. To increase the difficulty, it's common to spin the apples beforehand or shake the
            cords, often catching contestants who are unaware or too slow in the face
