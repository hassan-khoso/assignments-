        </h1>
        <p>oundnet (also commonly known as spikeball) is a net sport. The game is played between two teams, usually with
            two players each. Players initially line up around a small trampoline-like net at the start of a point. The
            game starts with a serve from one team to another, and teams alternate hitting the ball back to the net, and
            ends when the ball falls to the ground or an infraction occurs.
        </p>
        <P>Roundnet was originally created in 1989 by Jeff Knurek, inspired primarily by concepts from volleyball,
            although the equipment he created for the game became outdated and lost popularity in 1995. The sport
            experienced a revival in 2008 when Spikeball Inc. began promoting it. The company manufactures equipment for
            the sport, and so "spikeball" became a common name for the sport.

        <ul>
            <li>Materials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch
                circumference.</li>
            <li>Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing
                team on the other.
            </li>
            <li>Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player. Before the point starts, players will always
                be across the net from an opponent and next to their teammate.</li>
        </ul>
