        <p>
            Hopscotch is a popular playground game in which players toss a small object, called a lagger, into numbered
            triangles or a pattern of rectangles outlined on the ground and then hop or jump through the spaces and
            retrieve the object. It is a children's game that can be played with several players or alone. Hopscotch is
            physical and cognitive workout.
        </p>
        <P>The first player tosses a marker, also called a "lucky bean", onto the court.The marker (typically a small
            stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm) should land in the square without bouncing, sliding, or
            rolling out. (In Ireland, the marker is usually replaced with an old shoe polish tin or flat stone, called a
            piggy.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>To play hopscotch, a court is first laid out on the ground. Depending on the available surface, the
                court is either scratched out in the dirt or drawn with chalk on pavement.</li>
            <li>Courts may be permanently marked where playgrounds are commonly paved, as in elementary schools. Designs
                vary, but the court is usually composed of a series of linear squares interspersed with blocks of two
                lateral squares. </li>
            <li>Traditionally the court ends with a "safe" or "home" base in which the player may turn before completing
                the reverse trip.</li>
        </ul>
