            </h1>
            <p>The game is played by two to four players on a square game board imprinted with a 15Ã—15 grid of cells
                (individually known as "squares"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. In official club and
                tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams, each of which
                collaborates on a single rack
            </p>
            <P>The board is marked with "premium" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red
                "triple-word" squares, 17 pale red "double-word" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is
                marked with a star or other symbol, 12 dark blue "triple-letter" squares, and 24 pale blue
                "double-letter" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red
                for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL, but the original premium square color scheme is still preferred
                for Scrabble boards used in tournaments
            </P>
            <P>In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point
                value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's
                frequency in standard English. Commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less
                common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that
                are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once
                laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set
                distributions with different point values.
            </P>
            <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>a tile can be shifted or replaced until the play has been scored</li>
                <li>a challenge applies to all the words made in the given play.</li>
                <li>Playing all seven tiles is officially called a "bingo" in North America and a "bonus" elsewhere</li>
                <li>A change in the wording of the rules could have been interpreted as meaning that a player may form
                    more than one word on one row on a single turn</li>
                <li>A loss-of-turn penalty was added for challenging an acceptable play.</li>
