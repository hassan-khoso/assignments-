        <p>An egg-and-spoon race is a sporting event in which participants must balance an egg or similarly shaped item
            upon a spoon and race with it to the finishing line. At many primary schools an egg-and-spoon race is staged
            as part of the annual Sports Day, alongside other events such as the sack race and the three-legged race.
        </p>
        <P>In some schools, the use of raw eggs is banned on the grounds of health and safety and fears of allergy or of
            competitors contracting salmonella through accidental ingestion of the contents of a broken egg.[9] Punitive
            insurance premiums have also resulted in the cancellation of some events.The phrase "egg and spoon" features
            in The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English; its use, along with the idiom
            good egg with which it is sometimes confused, is frowned upon by the Metropolitan Police on the grounds of
            it being derogatory and rhyming slang for "coon".
        </P>
