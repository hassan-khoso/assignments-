        <p>
            A chessboard is a gameboard used to play chess. It consists of 64 squares, 8 rows by 8 columns, on which the
            chess pieces are placed. It is square in shape and uses two colours of squares, one light and one dark, in a
            chequered pattern. During play, the board is oriented such that each player's near-right corner square is a
            light square.
        </p>
        <P>The columns of a chessboard are known as files, the rows are known as ranks, and the lines of adjoining
            same-coloured squares (each running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge) are known as diagonals.
            Each square of the board is named using algebraic, descriptive, or numeric chess notation; algebraic
            notation is the FIDE standard. In algebraic notation, using White's perspective, files are labeled a through
            h from left to right, and ranks are labeled 1 through 8 from bottom to top; each square is identified by the
            file and rank which it occupies. The a- through d-files comprise the queenside, while the e- through h-files
            comprise the kingside.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Chess is a two-player abstract strategy board game. Each player controls sixteen pieces of six types on a chessboard.</li>
            <li>Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to checkmate (inescapably threaten with capture) the opponent's king.</li>
            <li>A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways in which a game can end in a draw.</li>
