    </h1> 
        <p>
            UNO is a multi-player card game in which the objective is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards
            in their hand. Each player is dealt 7 cards and players take turn drawing cards from the deck. If a player
            has a card in their hand matching the card they drew from the deck, they can play that card (helping to
            reduce the total cards in their hand).
        </p>
        <P>If the player doesn't have a matching card in their hand, they must draw another card from the deck to add to
            their hand, which increases the total number of cards they need to get rid of to win. When a player has only
            one card left in their hand, they must yell "UNO!," but if an opposing player notices before the original
            player has a chance to say "UNO," the original player must draw four more cards.
        </P>

        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A player who draws a playable card from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no
                other card from their hand on that turn.</li>
            <li>A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.</li>
            <li>If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is
                shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.</li>
