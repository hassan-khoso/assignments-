        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
            Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
            is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and
            Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
            football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to
            varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
        </p>
        <P>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
            parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
            English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire
            allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled
            Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football,
            for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain
            their heritage.In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional
            football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some
            of the most popular team sports in the world.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>football can be played on any type of pitch or surface but it is most usually played on a softball
                diamond.</li>
            <li>Games often consist of 6 innings, but this can be flexible when not playing under WAKA rules as long as
                both teams agree.
            </li>
            <li>Because football is usually played in school sports sessions, then team sizes can vary, although WAKA
                recommends teams should be between 8 and 11.</li>
