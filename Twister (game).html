            Twister is a game of physical skill produced by Milton Bradley Company and Winning Moves Games USA. It is
            played on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or ground. The mat has six rows of large colored
            circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green, and blue. A spinner tells players
            where they have to place their hand or foot. The game promotes itself as "the game that ties you up in
            knots".
        </p>
        <P>A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or
            foot. The spinner is divided into four labeled sections: left foot, right foot, left hand, and right hand.
            Each of those four sections are divided into the four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). After spinning,
            the combination is called (for example: "right hand yellow") and players must move their matching hand or
            foot to a circle of the correct color.

            In a two-player game, no two people can have a hand or foot on the same circle; the rules are different for
            more players. Owing to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in
            unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall. A person is eliminated when they fall
            or when their elbow or knee touches the mat.</P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Only one hand or foot per circle! The first player there occupies the circle. If you can't agree who got
                there first, the ref decides. The ref's decision is final.</li>
            <li>If all six circles of one color are taken, spin again.</li>
            <li>If the ref calls a hand/foot and color combination you're already doing, you must move your hand or foot
                to a different circle of the same color. (If all six are taken, spin again).</li>
        </ul>
