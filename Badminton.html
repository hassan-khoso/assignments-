        <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be
            played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
            "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or
            on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
            shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
        </p>
        <P>Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock
            has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the
            opposing side.
        </P>
