    </h1>  
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of
            which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
            stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball
            from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have
            legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the
            opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs
            when either the bowler unfairly bowls the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or
            the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent
            run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket")
        </p>
        <P>Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by
            the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
            before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have
            been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more
            runs wins, provided that the other team has completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is
            adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>football can be played on any type of pitch or surface but it is most usually played on a softball
                diamond.</li>
            <li>Games often consist of 6 innings, but this can be flexible when not playing under WAKA rules as long as
                both teams agree.
            </li>
            <li>Because football is usually played in school sports sessions, then team sizes can vary, although WAKA
                recommends teams should be between 8 and 11.</li>
        </ul>
