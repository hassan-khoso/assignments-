    </h1> 
        <p>Hide-and-seek (sometimes known as hide-and-go-seek) is a popular children's game in which at least two
            players (usually at least three)[1] conceal themselves in a set environment, to be found by one or more
            seekers. The game is played by one chosen player (designated as being "it") counting to a predetermined
            number with eyes closed while the other players hide. After reaching this number, the player who is "it"
            calls "Ready or not, here I come!" or "Coming, ready or not!" and then attempts to locate all concealed
            players.
        </p>
        <P>The game can end in one of several ways. The most common way of ending is the player chosen as "it" locates
            all players; the player found first is the loser and is chosen to be "it" in the next game. The player found
            last is the winner. Another common variation has the seeker counting at "home base"; the hiders can either
            remain hidden or they can come out of hiding to race to home base; once they touch it, they are "safe" and
            cannot be tagged.
        </P>
        <h1 class="head">Game rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The second version is the same as the first one except if the seekers find the hiders then the hider
                must sit out of the game.</li>
            <li>Once the game starts seekers must seek out where the hiders are. If the seekers finds the hiders, the
                hiders will then be converted to the seekers thus helping them find the hiders
            </li>
            <li>But the hiders can only be converted if they get tagged. They are allowed to run away from the seekers
                and hide in a new area.</li>
        </ul>
