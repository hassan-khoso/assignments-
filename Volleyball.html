        <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score
            points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the
            official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the
            programme at the Atlanta 1996. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting
            volleyball.
        </p>
        <P> volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with a width
            of one meter (39.4 in). The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11+11⁄16 in) above the center of the court
            for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4+3⁄16 in) for women's competition, varied for veterans and junior
            competitions.

        <ul>
            <li>The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23.0 ft), although a clearance of 8 m (26.2 ft) is recommended</li>
            <li>A line 3 m (9.8 ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" (or "10-foot") line divides the court into "back row" and "front row" areas (also back court and front court).</li>
            <li>These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area "1", which is the position of the serving player</li>
