        <p>Capture the flag (CTF) is a traditional outdoor sport where two or more teams each have a flag (or other
            markers) and the objective is to capture the other team's flag, located at the team's "base", and bring it
            safely back to their own base. Enemy players can be "tagged" by players in their home territory and,
            depending on the rules, they may be out of the game, become members of the opposite team, sent back to their
            own territory, or frozen in place ("in jail") until freed by a member of their own team.
        </p>
        <P>apture the Flag requires a playing field of some sort. In both indoor and outdoor versions, the field is
            divided into two clearly designated halves, known as territories. Players form two teams, one for each
            territory. Each side has a "flag" which is most often a piece of fabric, but can be any object small enough
            to be easily carried by a person (night time games might use flashlights, glowsticks or lanterns as the
            "flags"). Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see
            them. If one team has the opposing team's flag on their territory they may be tagged because they have the
            opposing team's flag.
